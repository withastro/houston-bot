Astro's own Houston, a bot made to provide support to our support team.

# How to build

To build, clone the repository and run `pnpm install` in the root directory to install all required dependencies.

After that, make a copy of [.env.example](.env.example) and rename it to `.env`. Then, fill out all the fields.

Finally, run `pnpm start` to automatically build and start the bot.
